The product bar MFE should stay original color execpt for product being dispensed and only while being dispensed, if not dispensing tile should return to original color


product costs are correctly adding for grand total
product costs per product are correctly tracking

but if you dispense multiple products, the volumn of product sold accumulates to each prodcut

product volumns should start at zero for each product not at previous products total

there is significant lag between credit card auth and auth display

currently reciept quickly flashes and disappears
when done button pressed, recipet should display for 10 seconds before reseting entire loop for next customer



The are you done screen should only show after a few seconds of inactivty between product dispensing and nowhere else
